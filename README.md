# [There's Waldo](https://github.com/ray-jonathan/theres-waldo) - Backend

The purpose of this *in-progress* repo is to develop the API necessary for managing all aspects of the [capture-the-flag game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag), **There's Waldo**.

### LEFT TO DO
- Convert PSQL backend to a noSQL, likely Mongo
- Wrap API in GraphQL to drastically simplify routes
- Continue to develop controllers for gameplay
- Allow for user image upload/storage (likely an S3 integration)
